I"›<p>Working with computer was always something I really enjoyed which is why becoming a software engineer was always my goal! I especially enjoy creating innovative and customer-tailored and operationalized cloud-applications which scale and are delivered continously.
As the cloud has become a key infrastructure in enabling developers to create innovations my goal has become designing and developing customer-tailored cloud-native systems with operationalized infrastructure that scales and delivers application continuously.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I always love the challenge of developing user-friendly web and mobile applications.</p>
